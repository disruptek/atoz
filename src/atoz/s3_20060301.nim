The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts. </p> <p>To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the <a>ListParts</a> operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.</p> <p>For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload API and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>The following operations are related to <code>AbortMultipartUpload</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UploadPart</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CompleteMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListParts</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListMultipartUploads</a> </p> </li> </ul>

  ## <p>Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.</p> <note> <p>You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, for copying an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p> </note> <p>When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>.</p> <important> <p>Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-region copies. If you request a cross-region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more information about transfer acceleration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html">Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p> </important> <p>All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i> access to the destination bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.</p> <p>To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the <code>Etag</code> matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the request parameters <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>, or <code> x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code>.</p> <note> <p>All headers with the <code>x-amz-</code> prefix, including <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, must be signed.</p> </note> <p>You can use this operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a>.</p> <p>The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. If the source object is encrypted, it can be encrypted by server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption keys or by using a customer-provided encryption key. When copying an object, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypt the target object by using either the AWS managed encryption keys or by using your own encryption key. You can do this regardless of the form of server-side encryption that was used to encrypt the source, or even if the source object was not encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.</p> </note> <p>Consider the following when using request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Consideration 1 – If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> condition evaluates to true</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> condition evaluates to false</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> Consideration 2 – If both of the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response code:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> condition evaluates to false</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> condition evaluates to true</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.</p> <p>Following are other considerations when using <code>CopyObject</code>:</p> <dl> <dt>Versioning</dt> <dd> <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. (If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted.) To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see .</p> </dd> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>To encrypt the target object, you must provide the appropriate encryption-related request headers. The one you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an AWS managed encryption key, provide the following request headers, as appropriate.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side​-encryption</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data. If you want to use a customer managed AWS KMS CMK, you must provide the <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code> of the symmetric customer managed CMK. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric CMKs and not asymmetric CMKs. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <important> <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in KMS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an encryption key that you provide, use the following headers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the source object is encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys, you must use the following headers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-copy-source-​server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in Amazon KMS</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-full-control</p> </li> </ul> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants the AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" </code> </p> </li> </ul> </dd> </dl> <p>The following operations are related to <code>CopyObject</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>PutObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetObject</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html">Copying Objects</a>.</p>

  ## <p>Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.</p> <note> <p>You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, for copying an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p> </note> <p>When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>.</p> <important> <p>Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-region copies. If you request a cross-region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more information about transfer acceleration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html">Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p> </important> <p>All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i> access to the destination bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.</p> <p>To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the <code>Etag</code> matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the request parameters <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>, or <code> x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code>.</p> <note> <p>All headers with the <code>x-amz-</code> prefix, including <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, must be signed.</p> </note> <p>You can use this operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a>.</p> <p>The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. If the source object is encrypted, it can be encrypted by server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption keys or by using a customer-provided encryption key. When copying an object, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypt the target object by using either the AWS managed encryption keys or by using your own encryption key. You can do this regardless of the form of server-side encryption that was used to encrypt the source, or even if the source object was not encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.</p> </note> <p>Consider the following when using request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Consideration 1 – If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> condition evaluates to true</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> condition evaluates to false</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> Consideration 2 – If both of the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response code:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> condition evaluates to false</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> condition evaluates to true</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.</p> <p>Following are other considerations when using <code>CopyObject</code>:</p> <dl> <dt>Versioning</dt> <dd> <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. (If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted.) To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see .</p> </dd> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>To encrypt the target object, you must provide the appropriate encryption-related request headers. The one you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an AWS managed encryption key, provide the following request headers, as appropriate.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side​-encryption</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data. If you want to use a customer managed AWS KMS CMK, you must provide the <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code> of the symmetric customer managed CMK.

By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3.

  ## copyObject
  ## <p>Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.</p> <note> <p>You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, for copying an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p> </note> <p>When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>.</p> <important> <p>Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-region copies. If you request a cross-region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more information about transfer acceleration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html">Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p> </important> <p>All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i> access to the destination bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.</p> <p>To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the <code>Etag</code> matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the request parameters <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>, or <code> x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code>.</p> <note> <p>All headers with the <code>x-amz-</code> prefix, including <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, must be signed.</p> </note> <p>You can use this operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a>.</p> <p>The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. If the source object is encrypted, it can be encrypted by server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption keys or by using a customer-provided encryption key. When copying an object, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypt the target object by using either the AWS managed encryption keys or by using your own encryption key. You can do this regardless of the form of server-side encryption that was used to encrypt the source, or even if the source object was not encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.</p> </note> <p>Consider the following when using request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Consideration 1 – If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> condition evaluates to true</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> condition evaluates to false</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> Consideration 2 – If both of the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response code:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> condition evaluates to false</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> condition evaluates to true</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.</p> <p>Following are other considerations when using <code>CopyObject</code>:</p> <dl> <dt>Versioning</dt> <dd> <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. (If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted.) To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see .</p> </dd> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>To encrypt the target object, you must provide the appropriate encryption-related request headers. The one you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an AWS managed encryption key, provide the following request headers, as appropriate.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side​-encryption</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.

  ## <p>This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see <a>UploadPart</a>). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.</p> <p>For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a>.</p> <p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config">Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy</a>.</p> <p>For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload API and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a>.</p> <note> <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a>UploadPart</a>) and <a>UploadPartCopy</a>) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p> <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Encrypt</code>, <code>kms:Decrypt</code>, <code>kms:ReEncrypt*</code>, <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code>, and <code>kms:DescribeKey</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload.</p> <p>If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p> <p> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <dl> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.</p> </note> <important> <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-full-control</p> </li> </ul> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants the AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" </code> </p> </li> </ul> </dd> </dl> <p>The following operations are related to <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>UploadPart</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CompleteMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AbortMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListParts</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListMultipartUploads</a> </p> </li> </ul>

  ## <p>This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see <a>UploadPart</a>). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.</p> <p>For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a>.</p> <p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config">Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy</a>.</p> <p>For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload API and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a>.</p> <note> <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a>UploadPart</a>) and <a>UploadPartCopy</a>) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p> <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Encrypt</code>, <code>kms:Decrypt</code>, <code>kms:ReEncrypt*</code>, <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code>, and <code>kms:DescribeKey</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload.</p> <p>If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p> <p> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <dl> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.</p> </note> <important> <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.

  ## createMultipartUpload
  ## <p>This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see <a>UploadPart</a>). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.</p> <p>For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a>.</p> <p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config">Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy</a>.</p> <p>For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload API and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a>.</p> <note> <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a>UploadPart</a>) and <a>UploadPartCopy</a>) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p> <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Encrypt</code>, <code>kms:Decrypt</code>, <code>kms:ReEncrypt*</code>, <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code>, and <code>kms:DescribeKey</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload.</p> <p>If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p> <p> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <dl> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.</p> </note> <important> <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-full-control</p> </li> </ul> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants the AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" </code> </p> </li> </ul> </dd> </dl> <p>The following operations are related to <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>UploadPart</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CompleteMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AbortMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListParts</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListMultipartUploads</a> </p> </li> </ul>

  ## <note> <p>Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The response describes the new filter element that you can use to specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule applies. If you are still using previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it works. For the earlier API description, see <a>GetBucketLifecycle</a>.</p> </note> <p>Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Object Lifecycle Management</a>.</p> <p>To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the <code>s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration</code> action.

  ## <p>Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.</p> <p>Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.</p> <p>Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p> <note> <p>To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body, use the <code>100-continue</code> HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example, because authentication fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the <code>100-continue</code> HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt</a>.</p> </note> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it.

When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p> <note> <p>To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body, use the <code>100-continue</code> HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example, because authentication fails or a redirect occurs).

  ## <p>Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.</p> <p>Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.</p> <p>Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p> <note> <p>To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body, use the <code>100-continue</code> HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example, because authentication fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the <code>100-continue</code> HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt</a>.</p> </note> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys.

If you grant <code>READ</code> access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.</p> <p>An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object <code>sample.jpg</code>, you can name it <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>.</p> <p>To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the <code>GET</code> operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>, specify the resource as <code>/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. For a path-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code> in the bucket named <code>examplebucket</code>, specify the resource as <code>/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>.

For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see <a>GetObjectAcl</a>.</p> <p>If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this operation returns an <code>InvalidObjectStateError</code> error.

These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code>. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.</p> <note> <p>You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.</p> </note> <ul> <li> <p> <code>response-content-type</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-content-language</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-expires</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-cache-control</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-content-disposition</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-content-encoding</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Additional Considerations about Request Headers</b> </p> <p>If both of the <code>If-Match</code> and <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <code>If-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, and; <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. </p> <p>If both of the <code>If-None-Match</code> and <code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows:<code> If-None-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, and; <code>If-Modified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.</p> <p>For more information about conditional requests, see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232">RFC 7232</a>.</p> <p>The following operations are related to <code>GetObject</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ListBuckets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetObjectAcl</a> </p> </li> </ul>

  ## <p>Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have <code>WRITE_ACP</code> permission.</p> <p>You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify the ACL in the request body</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify permissions using request headers</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.</p> </note> <p>Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.</p> <p> <b>Access Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-acl</code>. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-write</code> header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" </code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> <p> <b>Grantee Values</b> </p> <p>You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>By Email address:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> <p>The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.</p> </li> <li> <p>By the person's ID:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> <p>DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request</p> </li> <li> <p>By URI:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Related Resources</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateBucket</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteBucket</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetObjectAcl</a> </p> </li> </ul>

When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.

In the case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events</a>.</p> <p>You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element.</p> <p>By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with <code>s3:PutBucketNotification</code> permission.</p> <note> <p>The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT operation will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.</p> </note> <p> <b>Responses</b> </p> <p>If the configuration in the request body includes only one <code>TopicConfiguration</code> specifying only the <code>s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject</code> event type, the response will also include the <code>x-amz-sns-test-message-id</code> header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.</p> <p>The following operation is related to <code>PutBucketNotificationConfiguration</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>GetBucketNotificationConfiguration</a> </p> </li> </ul>

For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach.</p> <p> <b>Access Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants list objects permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" </code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> <p> <b>Grantee Values</b> </p> <p>You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>By Email address:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> <p>The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.</p> </li> <li> <p>By the person's ID:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> <p>DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>By URI:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Versioning</b> </p> <p>The ACL of an object is set at the object version level.

  ##   prefix: JString
  ##         : Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single result under CommonPrefixes. 
  ##   version-id-marker: JString

  ##   key-marker: JString
  ##             : Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.
  ##   max-keys: JInt
  ##           : Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search criteria, but were not returned because max-keys was exceeded, the response contains &lt;isTruncated&gt;true&lt;/isTruncated&gt;. To return the additional keys, see key-marker and version-id-marker.

For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.
  ##   delimiter: JString

All keys that contain the same string between the <code>prefix</code> and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes.

The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>When making a select request, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about the <code>S3</code> structure in the request body, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>PutObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Managing Access with ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body's <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The following expression returns all records from the specified object.</p> <p> <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.</p> <p> <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request body to <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field to <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.)

For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following are additional important facts about the select feature:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response <code>409</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Restoring Archives</b> </p> <p>Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from. </p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify. </p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new <code>Tier</code> request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the <code>Days</code> request element. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html"> Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a>PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Responses</b> </p> <p>A successful operation returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code. </p> <ul> <li> <p>If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns <code>202 Accepted</code> in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> in the response. </p> </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Special Errors</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p class="title"> <b/> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about the <code>S3</code> structure in the request body, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>PutObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Managing Access with ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body's <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The following expression returns all records from the specified object.</p> <p> <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.</p> <p> <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request body to <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query.

For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following are additional important facts about the select feature:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response <code>409</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Restoring Archives</b> </p> <p>Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from. </p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify. </p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new <code>Tier</code> request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the <code>Days</code> request element. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html"> Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a>PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Responses</b> </p> <p>A successful operation returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code. </p> <ul> <li> <p>If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns <code>202 Accepted</code> in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> in the response. </p> </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Special Errors</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p class="title"> <b/> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a>UploadPartCopy</a> operation. </p> </note> <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a>CreateMultipartUpload</a>) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.</p> <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the <code>Content-MD5</code> header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. </p> <p> <b>Note:</b> After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.</p> <p>For more information on multipart uploads, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide </i>.</p> <p>For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload API and Permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <a>CreateMultipartUpload</a>. For more information, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see <a>CreateMultipartUpload</a>.</p> <p>If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Special Errors</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p class="title"> <b/> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code: NoSuchUpload</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.
