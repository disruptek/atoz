## <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a>. </p> <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general information about the Query API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making Query Requests</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>. For information about using security tokens with other AWS products, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS Services That Work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/</a>. </p> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all AWS STS requests go to a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Global requests map to the US East (N. Virginia) region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token validity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by default. Those Regions are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. Some Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), must be manually enabled. To learn more about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. When you enable these AWS Regions, they are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. You cannot activate the STS endpoint for a Region that is disabled. Tokens that are valid in all AWS Regions are longer than tokens that are valid in Regions that are enabled by default. Changing this setting might affect existing systems where you temporarily store tokens. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-manage-tokens">Managing Global Endpoint Session Tokens</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After you activate a Region for use with AWS STS, you can direct AWS STS API calls to that Region. AWS STS recommends that you provide both the Region and endpoint when you make calls to a Regional endpoint. You can provide the Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). In this case, the calls are directed to the STS Regional endpoint. However, if you provide the Region alone for Regions enabled by default, the calls are directed to the global endpoint of <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>.</p> <p>To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by default, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#id_credentials_temp_enable-regions_writing_code">Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Recording API requests</b> </p> <p>STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on.</p> <p>If you activate AWS STS endpoints in Regions other than the default global endpoint, then you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those Regions. This is necessary to record any AWS STS API calls that are made in those Regions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html">Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions</a> in the <i>AWS CloudTrail User Guide</i>.</p> <p>AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Calls to this endpoint are logged as calls to a global service. However, because this endpoint is physically located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, your logs list <code>us-east-1</code> as the event Region. CloudTrail does not write these logs to the US East (Ohio) Region unless you choose to include global service logs in that Region. CloudTrail writes calls to all Regional endpoints to their respective Regions. For example, calls to sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com are published to the US East (Ohio) Region and calls to sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU (Frankfurt) Region.</p> <p>To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.</p> </important> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>

The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>The characters in this parameter count towards the 2048 character session policy guideline.

In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their AWS CloudTrail logs.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces.

  ##   ExternalId: JString
  ##             : <p>A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the <code>ExternalId</code> parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account.

For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>
  ##   TokenCode: string
  ##            : <p>The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA (that is, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the <code>TokenCode</code> value is missing or expired, the <code>AssumeRole</code> call returns an "access denied" error.</p> <p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.</p>
  ##   SerialNumber: string
  ##               : <p>The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the user who is making the <code>AssumeRole</code> call. Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as <code>GAHT12345678</code>) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user</code>).</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   RoleArn: string (required)
  ##          : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
  ##   DurationSeconds: int
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.

The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session.

  ##   RoleSessionName: string (required)
  ##                  : <p>An identifier for the assumed role session.</p> <p>Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their AWS CloudTrail logs.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   PolicyArns: JArray
  ##             : <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies.

  ##   ExternalId: string
  ##             : <p>A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the <code>ExternalId</code> parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see <a

Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed.

  ##   RoleArn: JString (required)
  ##          : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming.
  ##   PolicyArns: JArray
  ##             : <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs.

Your application must get this token by authenticating the user who is using your application with a web identity provider before the application makes an <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> call. 
  ##   RoleSessionName: JString (required)
  ##                  : <p>An identifier for the assumed role session. Typically, you pass the name or identifier that is associated with the user who is using your application. That way, the temporary security credentials that your application will use are associated with that user. This session name is included as part of the ARN and assumed role ID in the <code>AssumedRoleUser</code> response element.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   Policy: JString
  ##         : <p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.</p> <p>This parameter is optional.

  ##   DurationSeconds: JInt
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.

  ## postAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.</p> </important> <p>For more information about how to use web identity federation and the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_manual.html">Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://web-identity-federation-playground.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"> Web Identity Federation Playground</a>.

  ##   ProviderId: string
  ##             : <p>The fully qualified host component of the domain name of the identity provider.</p> <p>Specify this value only for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Currently <code>www.amazon.com</code> and <code>graph.facebook.com</code> are the only supported identity providers for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Do not include URL schemes and port numbers.</p> <p>Do not specify this value for OpenID Connect ID tokens.</p>
  ##   RoleArn: string (required)
  ##          : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming.
  ##   Action: string (required)
  ##   PolicyArns: JArray
  ##             : <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. However, the plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. For more information about ARNs, see <a

However, an AWS conversion compresses the session policies into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. This is the enforced limit. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policy is to the upper size limit.</p> </note> <p>Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.

  ##   WebIdentityToken: string (required)
  ##                   : The OAuth 2.0 access token or OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by the identity provider. Your application must get this token by authenticating the user who is using your application with a web identity provider before the application makes an <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> call. 
  ##   RoleSessionName: string (required)
  ##                  : <p>An identifier for the assumed role session. Typically, you pass the name or identifier that is associated with the user who is using your application. That way, the temporary security credentials that your application will use are associated with that user. This session name is included as part of the ARN and assumed role ID in the <code>AssumedRoleUser</code> response element.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   Policy: string
  ##         : <p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role.

The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>The characters in this parameter count towards the 2048 character session policy guideline. However, an AWS conversion compresses the session policies into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. This is the enforced limit. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policy is to the upper size limit.</p> </note>
  ##   Version: string (required)
  ##   DurationSeconds: int
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.

Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user.

Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed.

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>.</p> </note> <p>You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM API operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS API operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. The only exception is when the credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>. </p>

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error.

  ##   TokenCode: string
  ##            : <p>The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any policy requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this value. If MFA authentication is required, the user must provide a code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A user who fails to provide the code receives an "access denied" response when requesting resources that require MFA authentication.</p> <p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.</p>
  ##   SerialNumber: string
  ##               : <p>The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the IAM user who is making the <code>GetSessionToken</code> call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as <code>GAHT12345678</code>) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user</code>). You can find the device for an IAM user by going to the AWS Management Console and viewing the user's security credentials. </p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-</p>
  ##   DurationSeconds: int
  ##                  : The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid. Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is longer than one hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.
