## <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a>. </p> <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general information about the Query API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making Query Requests</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>. For information about using security tokens with other AWS products, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS Services That Work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/</a>. </p> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all AWS STS requests go to a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Global requests map to the US East (N. Virginia) region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token validity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by default. Those Regions are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. Some Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), must be manually enabled. To learn more about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. When you enable these AWS Regions, they are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. You cannot activate the STS endpoint for a Region that is disabled. Tokens that are valid in all AWS Regions are longer than tokens that are valid in Regions that are enabled by default. Changing this setting might affect existing systems where you temporarily store tokens. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-manage-tokens">Managing Global Endpoint Session Tokens</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After you activate a Region for use with AWS STS, you can direct AWS STS API calls to that Region. AWS STS recommends that you provide both the Region and endpoint when you make calls to a Regional endpoint. You can provide the Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). In this case, the calls are directed to the STS Regional endpoint. However, if you provide the Region alone for Regions enabled by default, the calls are directed to the global endpoint of <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>.</p> <p>To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by default, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#id_credentials_temp_enable-regions_writing_code">Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Recording API requests</b> </p> <p>STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on.</p> <p>If you activate AWS STS endpoints in Regions other than the default global endpoint, then you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those Regions. This is necessary to record any AWS STS API calls that are made in those Regions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html">Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions</a> in the <i>AWS CloudTrail User Guide</i>.</p> <p>AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Calls to this endpoint are logged as calls to a global service. However, because this endpoint is physically located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, your logs list <code>us-east-1</code> as the event Region. CloudTrail does not write these logs to the US East (Ohio) Region unless you choose to include global service logs in that Region. CloudTrail writes calls to all Regional endpoints to their respective Regions. For example, calls to sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com are published to the US East (Ohio) Region and calls to sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU (Frankfurt) Region.</p> <p>To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.</p> </important> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>

In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their AWS CloudTrail logs.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   PolicyArns: JArray
  ##             : <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. However, the plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information about ARNs, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces</a> in the AWS General Reference.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role.

Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as <code>GAHT12345678</code>) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user</code>).</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   DurationSeconds: JInt
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>By default, the value is set to <code>3600</code> seconds. </p> <note> <p>The <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more information, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html">Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
  ##   ExternalId: JString
  ##             : <p>A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the <code>ExternalId</code> parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html">How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-</p>
  ##   Policy: JString
  ##         : <p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note>
  ##   Tags: JArray
  ##       : <p>A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Tagging AWS STS Sessions</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with the same key. </p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the role has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.</p> <p>Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a session, see the AWS CloudTrail logs. For more information, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs">Viewing Session Tags in CloudTrail</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
  ##   TransitiveTagKeys: JArray
  ##                    : <p>A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the session policy and session tags packed binary limit is not affected.</p> <p>If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.</p>
  ##   TokenCode: JString
  ##            : <p>The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA (that is, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the <code>TokenCode</code> value is missing or expired, the <code>AssumeRole</code> call returns an "access denied" error.</p> <p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.</p>

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.</p> </important> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive.

This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>

You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.</p> </important> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role.

In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their AWS CloudTrail logs.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces.

If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the <code>ExternalId</code> parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html">How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-</p>
  ##   Version: string (required)
  ##   Policy: string
  ##         : <p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note>
  ##   DurationSeconds: int
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.

The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session.

Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS services.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. Your role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code> value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies.

The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the <code>NameID</code> element of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a <code>NameIDType</code> that is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the persistent identifier (<code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</code>).</p> </important> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML assertion as session tags.

For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags.

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated via a SAML authentication response.

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Identities</b> </p> <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.</p> </important> <p>For more information about how to use web identity federation and the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_manual.html">Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://web-identity-federation-playground.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"> Web Identity Federation Playground</a>.

You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user.

Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session.

  ##   DurationSeconds: int
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails.

  ##   WebIdentityToken: string (required)
  ##                   : The OAuth 2.0 access token or OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by the identity provider. Your application must get this token by authenticating the user who is using your application with a web identity provider before the application makes an <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> call. 
  ##   Policy: string

The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.

You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies.

  ## getAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Identities</b> </p> <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.</p> </important> <p>For more information about how to use web identity federation and the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_manual.html">Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://web-identity-federation-playground.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"> Web Identity Federation Playground</a>.

  ##   PolicyArns: JArray
  ##             : <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs.

  ##   RoleArn: string (required)
  ##          : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming.
  ##   ProviderId: string
  ##             : <p>The fully qualified host component of the domain name of the identity provider.</p> <p>Specify this value only for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Currently <code>www.amazon.com</code> and <code>graph.facebook.com</code> are the only supported identity providers for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Do not include URL schemes and port numbers.</p> <p>Do not specify this value for OpenID Connect ID tokens.</p>
  ##   RoleSessionName: string (required)
  ##                  : <p>An identifier for the assumed role session. Typically, you pass the name or identifier that is associated with the user who is using your application. That way, the temporary security credentials that your application will use are associated with that user. This session name is included as part of the ARN and assumed role ID in the <code>AssumedRoleUser</code> response element.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
  ##   WebIdentityToken: string (required)
  ##                   : The OAuth 2.0 access token or OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by the identity provider. Your application must get this token by authenticating the user who is using your application with a web identity provider before the application makes an <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> call. 
  ##   Action: string (required)
  ##   Version: string (required)
  ##   Policy: string
  ##         : <p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.</p> <p>This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note>
  ##   DurationSeconds: int
  ##                  : <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a 
  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>By default, the value is set to <code>3600</code> seconds. </p> <note> <p>The <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session.

  ## <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any AWS service except the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API. </p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>. </p> <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>

  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>This parameter is optional.

Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the user you are federating. When you do, session tags override a user tag with the same key. </p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the role has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.</p>
  ##   Name: JString (required)
  ##       : <p>The name of the federated user. The name is used as an identifier for the temporary security credentials (such as <code>Bob</code>). For example, you can reference the federated user name in a resource-based policy, such as in an Amazon S3 bucket policy.</p> <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces.

However, if you do not pass any session policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.</p> <p>When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a

If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted by the session policies.</p> <p>The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.

  ##   DurationSeconds: JInt
  ##                  : The duration, in seconds, that the session should last. Acceptable durations for federation sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the default. Sessions obtained using AWS account root user credentials are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the specified duration is longer than one hour, the session obtained by using root user credentials defaults to one hour.

  ## href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted by the session policies.</p> <p>The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note>

Sessions obtained using AWS account root user credentials are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour).
